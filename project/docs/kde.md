KDE settings can be customized through the __System Settings__ application found in 
_Application Launcher --> Settings --> System Settings_. A convenient shortcut for System Settings can be found on the system panel as well. KDE is extremely customizabl,to find more specific help visit the [Plasma Wiki](https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma)

Keybindings or keyboard shortcuts are an efficient way to interact with KDE without having to use the mouse. In __System Settings__ click __Shortcuts__ under the "Workspace" category.
You will be able to find any pre-existing shortcuts for many KDE applications as well as create your own shortcuts for any applications you install yourself. The __Custom Shortcuts_ menu allows you to create shortcuts for almost any system task.
